## Ashai

### About the Project

Ashai is an individual project that I built using React/Redux, Rails and PostgreSQL. The project is a clone of the project management application, Asana. The site allows users to assign tasks to themselves and one another. Users are organized into function-oriented teams and goal-oriented projects. 

The project features a lot of detailed features: user authentication, modals galore, responsive search bars, a bunch of handmade animations and plenty of easter eggs for those who know where to look.
